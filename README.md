# Game Of Life

_**Game of Life implementation counting neighbors using matrices rotations**_

## How it Works

The main inspiration I got for this implementation was from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMslgySQ8nc)
The guy is using APL (an array oriented language) and its calculating neighbors by every rotation of a single matrix

This are all the rotation, we will sum those and count neighbors (it also resolves problems created by borders)

I decided I wanted to try this in JS and here we are.
