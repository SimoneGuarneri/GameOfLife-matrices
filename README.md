## How it Works

The main inspiration I got for this implementation was from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMslgySQ8nc)
The guy is using APL (an array oriented language) and its calculating neighbors by every rotation of a single matrix

I decided I wanted to try this in JS and here we are.
